Create an "admin" page that will allow you to create new blog posts and edit and delete existing ones
You may be able to link to your existing pages for editing and deleting posts
Make sure you protect your admin page, and the edit/delete pages (require login)
Any "admin-type" functionality should not be visible from the "public" pages. Those functions should only appear on the admin page(s):
Create a new post
Edit a post
Delete a post
